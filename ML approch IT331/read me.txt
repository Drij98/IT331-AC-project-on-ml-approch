# IT 331
# Project by Drij gajera and alice moradiya
# We devided all of our wirk evenly 
# Drij - I did the findings of machile lerning approches and used 4 of them in the implementation of th code and trained the model
# Alice - I did the the lexical feture part from finding ,using, implementing  and train them it is mine part

# we both worked on the suggetion that you gave us on the presantyation day and we added 13 more features to the lexicasl features 
# and we got an improved accuracy_score then before

# use the atteched file check the name of the file should be same
